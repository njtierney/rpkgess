# About this {-}

This is a book on the essential components of creating an R package. It is aimed at those who want to learn how to make R packages. You probably have written some functions, but if you haven't, we discuss how to do that. I care a lot about writing functions, and have a lot of thoughts and ideas on how to do it.

It was initially developed as a full-day hour workshop, ["R package essentials"](https://rpkgess.njtierney.com/). It is a developed into a resource that will grow and change over time as a **living book**.

# About this {-}

This is a book on the essential components of creating an R package. It is aimed at those who want to learn how to make R packages. You probably have written some functions, but if you haven't, we discuss how to do that. I care a lot about writing functions, and have a lot of thoughts and ideas on how to do it.

It was initially developed as a full-day hour workshop, ["R package essentials"](https://rpkgess.njtierney.com/). It is a developed into a resource that will grow and change over time as a **living book**.

This book aims to teach the following:

- Installation and setup of dependencies
  - git + github
  - R, RStudio
  - package dependencies
- Function essentials
  - DRY;DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself; Don't Reread Yourself)
  - Expression
  - Finding the inputs
- Moving a script to a series of functions
- Create package barebones with `create_package()`
- How to add dependencies with `use_package()` - DESCRIPTION file
- How to add documentation with `roxygen2`
- Why you should use R CMD Check
- How to add data to a package
- How to add a README
- How to put your package on github
- How to add vignettes
- Writing tests
- Using a NEWS file
- Adding a website
- Using Continuous Integration to check and test
- Publishing your software on R universe

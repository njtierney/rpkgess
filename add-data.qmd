# Adding data to an R package

overall goals
- add raw 2014 data
- add tidy 2014 data

- demonstrate using data-raw/dataset.R
  - briefly discuss compression = "xz"
- show using set.seed(yyyy-mm-dd) / providing a date

- demo now by having the data be used without read_csv in scratch.R

But now just use library, not load all - see that there's no functions!

So now go on to having documentation and @export

## Using tests

- `use_testthat()`
- re-examine data quality checks
- explain moving from less-formal to more formalised approach

- demonstrate testing dimensions/names

- demonstrate snapshot tests

```r
expect_snapshot(clean_data(raw_education_2014))
```

- demonstrate vdiffr tests

```r
set.seed(2025-04-11)
plot_name <- plot_code(data)

test_that("plot works", {
  skip_on_cran()
  skip_on_ci()
  vdiffr::expect_doppelganger("plot_name", plot_name)
})
```


- circle back to the data quality checks

- touch on the idea that R packages can be used for other things than CRAN - although this does maybe go against some ideas in this course, the R package structure can be exploited to do some cool things - like perhaps data validation?

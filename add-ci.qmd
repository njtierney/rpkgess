## Using Continuous Integration

It's nice to run tests and checks locally, but we can actually set things up to happen automatically every time we psuh to GitHub.

To do this, run:

```r
#  (singular, not plural)
use_github_action()
```

And follow the prompts


- This is all much easier than it used to be
- Explain that there is a game of "watching the green lights"
- Explain test coverage
  - see `covr::report()`

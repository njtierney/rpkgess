# Adding a vignette

We have already covered this earlier, but recap this, and also check that the vignette is now building properly


:::{.callout-info title="Your turn" collapse="true"}

1. Open up "analysis-2014.qmd"
2. Remove "Your Tasks"
3. Remove "Functions"
4. Update the Data cleaning so you can it interactively to read in the "raw_education_2014.csv" data (NB: we will eventually move this data into the R package itself)

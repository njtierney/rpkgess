You probably have written some functions, but if you haven’t, we discuss how to do that. I care a lot about writing functions, and have a lot of thoughts and ideas on how to do it.\nIt was initially developed as a full-day hour workshop, “R package essentials”. It is a developed into a resource that will grow and change over time as a living book.\nThis book aims to teach the following:",

    "text": "I first learnt to write an R package from [Hilary Parker’s famous blog post, “Writing an R package from scratch”. Then I consulted Hadley Wickham’s “R packages” book (1st edition). I consider the “R packages” book (now in its second edition, by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan), to be the authority on best practices for package development, alongside the rOpenSci guide, “rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review”, by Salmon et al. \nThese are excellent pieces of reference test, however I think there is a need for a resource that sits somewhere between a blog post on making an R package, and resource. I want something that contains just enough information to get you started on the right path to making an R package. This is what that book represents to me. Along the way I’ll include breadcrumbs to other resources to look into when you want to learn more.\nThis book also represents my efforts to explain the key parts of what I think people should know about how to write functions, and also to format this in a teachable way that can be covered in a single workshop.\nThere are more comprehensive guides, and other guides out there for writing R packages. It has been the fundamental way people have shared code and ideas. So I want to share some resources I really enjoyed and think are great:\n\n\n\n\nSo, why write a book?\n\nSimilar to my book, “Quarto for Scientists”, writing this as a book provides a nice way to structure the content in the form of a workshop, in a way suitable for learning in a day. It is not to say that there aren’t already the resources out there; there are. It is instead adding to the list of other (useful, hopefully!) information out there on the internet. To answer a question with another question: “Why NOT write this as a book?”",

    "text": "3.4 What is RStudio, and why should I use it?\n\nIf R is the engine and bare bones of your car, then RStudio is like the rest of the car.\n\nThe engine is super critical part of your car. But in order to make things properly functional, you need to have a steering wheel, comfy seats, a radio, rear and side view mirrors, storage, and seatbelts. RStudio is all those niceties\nThe RStudio layout has the following features:\n\nOn the upper left, the Quarto script\nOn the lower left, the R console\nOn the lower right, the view for files, plots, packages, help, and viewer.\nOn the upper right, the environment / history pane\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the RStudio working environment.\n\n\n\n\nWe saw a bit of what an Quarto script does.\n\nThe R console is the bit where you can run your code.\nThe file/plot/package viewer is a handy browser for your current files, like Finder, or File Explorer.\nPlots are where your plots appear, you can view packages, see the help files.\nThe environment / history pane contains the list of things you have created, and the past commands that you have run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Turn: RStudio default options\n\n\n\nTo first get set up, I highly recommend changing the following setting\nTools &gt; Global Options (or Cmd + , on macOS)\nUnder the General tab:\n\nFor workspace:\n\nUncheck restore .RData into workspace at startup.\nSave workspace to .RData on exit : “Never”.\n\nFor History:\n\nUncheck “Always save history (even when not saving .RData).\nUncheck “Remove duplicate entries in history”.\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting the options right for RStudio, so you don’t restore previous sessions work, and don’t save it either.\n\n\nThis means that you won’t save the objects and other things that you create in your R session and reload them. This is important for two reasons\n\nReproducibility: you don’t want to have objects from last week cluttering your session\nPrivacy: you don’t want to save private data or other things to your session. You only want to read these in.\n\nYour “history” is the commands that you have entered into R.\nAdditionally, not saving your history means that you won’t be relying on things that you typed in the last session, which is a good habit to get into!",

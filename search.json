I care a lot about writing functions, and have a lot of thoughts and ideas on how to do it.\nIt was initially developed as a full-day hour workshop, “R package essentials”. It is a developed into a resource that will grow and change over time as a living book.\nThis book aims to teach the following:",

    "text": "I first learnt to write an R package from [Hilary Parker’s famous blog post, “Writing an R package from scratch”. Then I consulted Hadley Wickham’s “R packages” book (1st edition). I consider the “R packages” book (now in its second edition, by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan), to be the authority on best practices for package development, alongside the rOpenSci guide, “rOpenSci Packages: Development, Maintenance, and Peer Review”, by Salmon et al. \nThese are excellent pieces of reference test, however I think there is a need for a resource that sits somewhere between a blog post on making an R package, and resource. I want something that contains just enough information to get you started on the right path to making an R package. This is what that book represents to me. Along the way I’ll include breadcrumbs to other resources to look into when you want to learn more.\nThis book also represents my efforts to explain the key parts of what I think people should know about how to write functions, and also to format this in a teachable way that can be covered in a single workshop.\nThere are more comprehensive guides, and other guides out there for writing R packages. It has been the fundamental way people have shared code and ideas. So I want to share some resources I really enjoyed and think are great:\n\n\n\n\nSo, why write a book?\n\nSimilar to my book, “Quarto for Scientists”, writing this as a book provides a nice way to structure the content in the form of a workshop, in a way suitable for learning in a day. It is not to say that there aren’t already the resources out there; there are. It is instead adding to the list of other (useful, hopefully!) information out there on the internet. To answer a question with another question: “Why NOT write this as a book?”",

    "text": "2.3 Software Setup\n\n2.3.1 Installing R\n\nWindowsMacOSLinux\n\n\nhttps://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/\n\n\nhttps://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/\n\n\nhttps://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Installing RStudio\nhttps://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download\n\n\n2.3.3 Installing R packages for development\nTo ensure you are up to date, run the following script to install the packages.\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"devtools\", \"roxygen2\", \"testthat\", \"knitr\", \"pak\"))\n\n\n2.3.3.1 Personalising your R Profile\nThis is really neat, and I think it’s actually worthwhile doing, but it does take up some time, and there are some warnings.\nAs you develop R packages, you’ll need to go through a cycle of restarting R, and loading things up to be ready. One of the issues with this is that you’ll find yourself writing code like:\n\nlibrary(devtools)\n\nA lot. To save you time, we can edit a very special file called “The R profile”, which is saved as .RProfile. This code is special, and awesome, because it is run every time you start R. It is also dangerous, for exactly the same reason.\nI recommend running the following code from devtools to help set this up:\nuse_devtools()\nWhich will bring up the following message:\n☐ Include this code in .Rprofile to make devtools\n  available in all interactive sessions:\n  if (interactive()) {\n    suppressMessages(require(devtools))\n  }\n  [Copied to clipboard]\n☐ Modify /Users/nick/.Rprofile.\n☐ Restart R for changes to take effect.\nSo, copy and paste the above, which I will now explain. There are three parts to this that I will break down:\nrequire(devtools)\nwe usually recommend writing library(devtools), but in this instance, require is what we want, because if the package is not installed, require will throw a warning, rather than an error:\n\n# warn\nrequire(whatevenisthis)\n\nLoading required package: whatevenisthis\n\n\nWarning in library(package, lib.loc = lib.loc, character.only = TRUE,\nlogical.return = TRUE, : there is no package called 'whatevenisthis'\n\n# error\nlibrary(whatevenisthis)\n\nError in library(whatevenisthis): there is no package called 'whatevenisthis'\n\n\nWe do not want an error when we start R, it is annoying.\nsuppressMessages()\nThis code suppresses any messages that appear from running this code, which again, we want, because we don’t (generally) want our R session to announce something upon startup.\n  if (interactive()) {\n    suppressMessages(require(devtools))\n  }\nThis means that this code is only run if the R session is interactive. This always felt a bit strange to me - because I had only ever run R interactively. But you don’t want to run require(devtools) when we aren’t using R interactively, because it means we are potentially changing the state of things. Essentially, it’s good practice.\nAlso, here are a couple of times that you might not realise you are using R non-interactively:\n\nrendering a document using quarto or rmarkdown\nbuilding an R package (which you’ll learn about later)\n\nYou also use R non-interactively when you are running Rscript in the command line.\nFinally, another bit of useful code in your R profile is something like this:\n# usethis options\noptions(\n  usethis.full_name = \"Nicholas Tierney\",\n  usethis.protocol = \"https\",\n  usethis.description = list(\n    `Authors@R` = '\n    c(\n      person(\n        given = \"Nicholas\",\n        family = \"Tierney\",\n        role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\"),\n        email = \"nicholas.tierney@gmail.com\",\n        comment = c(ORCID = \"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1460-8722\")\n      )\n    )',\n    License = \"MIT + file LICENSE\",\n    Language = \"en-GB\",\n    Version = \"0.0.0.9000\"\n  ),\n  # set SI to true\n  reprex.session_info = TRUE\n)\nThis helps when setting up your R package for the first time, to make sure you set up your DESCRIPTION file. It isn’t required, but it is neat, and I think worthwhile.\nBecause I need to set these things up on different laptops sometimes, I actually write all these files to github. They are typically called “dotfiles” - you can see mine at http://github.com/njtierney/dotfiles.\n\n\n\n2.3.4 git and github\nVery briefly, git is essentially a way of managing versions and changes. You can think of it like a product such as dropbox, but with super powers. You can go back in time, you can make copies for changing, and delicately and precisely mege them back in, or leave them where they are.\nYour software needs a home. You’ll typically start with your project on your laptop or computer. GitHub is where you can store it online. The benefits to sharing your work on github are many, but my personal top reasons are:\n\nBuild trust in your software. If the community can see your code, they can trust it better.\nProvides a way to log ideas and bugs via issues.\nProvides a way for the community to contribute to your code.\n\nMy favourite book on using git and github with R is the book “happy git with R” By Jenny Bryan, Jim Hester, and the Stat 545 TAs. Honestly, it’s hard to recommend better installation instructions than their battle tested ones, so I’ll point you to this resource in case you run into troubles here.\n\n2.3.4.1 setting up github\nGetting set up on github you need an account. It’s easy enough to set up - go to https://github.com/ . When picking a username, I recommend the following:\n\nKeep it short. jsmith is better than jonathansmith.\nAvoid numbers and jokes. jsmith is better than jsmith123\nKeep it professional. jsmithisthebest\nKeep it lowercase\n\n\n\n2.3.4.2 installing git\nInstalling git can sometimes be a challenge. This is largely because there are different ways to install it on windows vs mac vs linux. As states earlier, the best, most battle tested instructions are at https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.\nOnce you’ve installed git, I recommend running this:\n\nusethis::git_vaccinate()\n\n✔ Configuring 'core.excludesFile': '~/.gitignore'\n\n\n✔ Creating the global (user-level) gitignore: '~/.gitignore'\n\n\n✔ Adding \".Rproj.user\", \".Rhistory\", \".Rdata\", \".httr-oauth\", \".DS_Store\", and\n  \".quarto\" to '/home/runner/.gitignore'.\n\n\nWhich ensures that you ignore specific files (specifically, Rproj.user, .Rhistory, .Rdata, .httr-oauth, .DS_Store, and .quarto). This is important because it decreases your chances of leaking credentials or other important details to GitHub.\n\n\n2.3.4.3 The “git handshake”\nIn order for your computer to talk to git and github properly, it needs to know three things:\n\nName\nEmail\nCredentials\n\ngit needs to know your name and email - this should be the name and email you used to set up your github account. Set this up with use_git_config()\n\nlibrary(usethis)\nuse_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Ned Kelly\", \n  user.email = \"ned@example.org\"\n)\n\ngithub needs a personal access token - this is so you can talk to github from R. This becomes really handy, and dare I say it, nearly magical later on. To get this, run:\nusethis::create_github_token()\nThis will open up GitHub and create a Personal Access Token. If this doesn’t work, go to https://github.com/settings/tokens and click “Generate New Token”, and select the (classic).”\nGenerally speaking you want the following scopes selected: “repo”, “user”, and “workflow”.\nA token will be created - keep this page open, and copy the token to your clipboard.\nThen, go to R, and run:\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\nAnd paste this PAT code in. Then, verify all of this with:\nusethis::git_sitrep()\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Installing RTools\nThis is actually something that you only need to do if you want to use C or C++ with your R package, which isn’t something you need to do for this course. To read more on this, see “The R build toolchain” from the R Packages book.",

But in order to make things properly functional, you need to have a steering wheel, comfy seats, a radio, rear and side view mirrors, storage, and seatbelts. RStudio is all those niceties\nThe RStudio layout has the following features:\n\nOn the upper left, the Quarto script\nOn the lower left, the R console\nOn the lower right, the view for files, plots, packages, help, and viewer.\nOn the upper right, the environment / history pane\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the RStudio working environment.\n\n\n\n\nWe saw a bit of what an Quarto script does.\n\nThe R console is the bit where you can run your code.\nThe file/plot/package viewer is a handy browser for your current files, like Finder, or File Explorer.\nPlots are where your plots appear, you can view packages, see the help files.\nThe environment / history pane contains the list of things you have created, and the past commands that you have run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Turn: RStudio default options\n\n\n\nTo first get set up, I highly recommend changing the following setting\nTools &gt; Global Options (or Cmd + , on macOS)\nUnder the General tab:\n\nFor workspace:\n\nUncheck restore .RData into workspace at startup.\nSave workspace to .RData on exit : “Never”.\n\nFor History:\n\nUncheck “Always save history (even when not saving .RData).\nUncheck “Remove duplicate entries in history”.\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting the options right for RStudio, so you don’t restore previous sessions work, and don’t save it either.\n\n\nThis means that you won’t save the objects and other things that you create in your R session and reload them. This is important for two reasons\n\nReproducibility: you don’t want to have objects from last week cluttering your session\nPrivacy: you don’t want to save private data or other things to your session. You only want to read these in.\n\nYour “history” is the commands that you have entered into R.\nAdditionally, not saving your history means that you won’t be relying on things that you typed in the last session, which is a good habit to get into!",

    "section": "5.8 How to think about writing functions",
    "text": "5.8 How to think about writing functions\nThere are many ways to start writing functions. Fundamentally, it is about identifying inputs and outputs. One useful approach, I think, is to identify the outputs before the inputs:\n\nThe output. What one thing do you want this function to return?\nThe input. What (potentially many things) goes in to this.\n\nThis “gestalt”, or top-down approach isn’t how it always needs to be done. But I think it helps you identify the thing you need first, which can help guide you.\n\n5.8.1 Identifying the output - what do we need?\nIt might feel a bit like putting the cart before the horse, but I think there is a nice advantage to thinking about the output first: you focus on what you want the function to do.\nIn the case of our clean_age_groups function, we want to get values like “15_19” that are factors.\n\n\n5.8.2 Identifying the input\nSo now we have a clear idea of what we need - we can now clarify what we have, which in our case earlier, was some contact data\n\ncontact\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  location age_groups n_contacts\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 QLD      15-19             100\n2 NSW      15--19            125\n3 QLD      20--24            150\n4 NSW      20-24             200\n5 QLD      25---29           225\n6 NSW      25-29             250\n\n\nWhere we want to focus on age groups, and take inputs like\n\nc(\"15-19\", \"15--19\")\n\n[1] \"15-19\"  \"15--19\"\n\n\nAnd then turn them into:\n\nc(\"15_19\", \"15_19\")\n\n[1] \"15_19\" \"15_19\"\n\n\nBreaking things down like this means we can focus on a really small example of the thing we want, which makes the problem easier to solve.\nThere are many ways to manage turning strings into other strings, and I like to use the stringr package to do this. We can use the str_replace_all function. So I’ll start by scratching up some inputs like so, and seeing if this works\n\nages &lt;- c(\"15-19\", \"15--19\")\nstr_replace_all(\n  string = ages,\n  pattern = \"-\",\n  replacement = \"_\"\n)\n\n[1] \"15_19\"  \"15__19\"\n\n\n\n5.8.2.1 Iteration: Writing functions is writing\nI didn’t get this right the first time - and I rarely do! The point I want to make here is:\n\nWriting functions is just like writing. It takes iteration.\n\nWe have incidentally replaced every “-” with “_“, which means”–” becomes “__“.\nLet’s change that by using | in the “pattern” argument, which allows us to specify “-|–”, which means, “-” OR “–”:\n\nages &lt;- c(\"15-19\", \"15--19\")\nstr_replace_all(\n  string = ages,\n  pattern = \"-|--\",\n  replacement = \"_\"\n)\n\n[1] \"15_19\"  \"15__19\"\n\n\nOK, the same problem. We actually need to flip the order here, so we change “–” first:\n\nages &lt;- c(\"15-19\", \"15--19\")\nstr_replace_all(\n  string = ages,\n  pattern = \"--|-\",\n  replacement = \"_\"\n)\n\n[1] \"15_19\" \"15_19\"\n\n\nGreat! Now let’s put that into the body of the function, and give the function a good name.\n\nclean_age_groups &lt;- function(age_groups){\n  str_replace_all(\n  string = ages,\n  pattern = \"--|-\",\n  replacement = \"_\"\n)\n}\n\nclean_age_groups(ages)\n\n[1] \"15_19\" \"15_19\"\n\n\nIt’s a useful process to scratch out a function like this. As you get more confident with this, you will start to be able to write the code as a function first, and then iterate in that way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeware copying and pasting into functions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process of writing a function out in scratchings as we’ve done, is that we can leave some scraps in the code. In this case, I’ve actually left the ages object in the function, but the argument is age_groups:\n\nclean_age_groups &lt;- function(age_groups){\n  str_replace_all(\n  string = ages,\n  pattern = \"--|-\",\n  replacement = \"_\"\n)\n}\n\nclean_age_groups(ages)\n\n[1] \"15_19\" \"15_19\"\n\n\nNotice that this still works! This is because the ages object still exists as a variable I’ve created. But if we try another input, we’ll get some strange output:\n\nclean_age_groups(c(\"10-12\", \"10--12\"))\n\n[1] \"15_19\" \"15_19\"\n\n\nSo, make sure to clean up after you’ve copied and pasted - remember to check the arguments match how they are used in the function.\nAnd on that note, let’s redefine clean_age_groups correctly so we don’t get an error later on (which happened during the development of the book)\n\nclean_age_groups &lt;- function(age_groups){\n  str_replace_all(\n  string = age_groups,\n  pattern = \"--|-\",\n  replacement = \"_\"\n)\n}\n\nclean_age_groups(ages)\n\n[1] \"15_19\" \"15_19\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.8.3 Managing scope - functions are best (generally) when they do one thing.\nAlso, note that we wrote clean_age_groups to just focus on converting input like “10–12” into “10_12”. We could have instead focussed on cleaning up the data frame, like so:\n\ncontact\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  location age_groups n_contacts\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 QLD      15-19             100\n2 NSW      15--19            125\n3 QLD      20--24            150\n4 NSW      20-24             200\n5 QLD      25---29           225\n6 NSW      25-29             250\n\nclean_age_groups_data &lt;- function(data){\n  \n  tidy_contact &lt;- data |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    age_groups = str_replace_all(\n      string = age_groups, \n      pattern = \"---|--|-\",\n      replacement = \"_\"\n      ),\n    age_groups = as.factor(age_groups)\n  )\n  \n  tidy_contact\n\n}\n\nclean_age_groups_data(contact)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  location age_groups n_contacts\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 QLD      15_19             100\n2 NSW      15_19             125\n3 QLD      20_24             150\n4 NSW      20_24             200\n5 QLD      25_29             225\n6 NSW      25_29             250\n\n\nI think there are a couple of issues with this:\n\nWe assume the age groups column is always age_groups\nThe scope is now larger - we are always working with data and returning data\nWe haven’t necessarily made the expression easier.\n\nIt is fine to wrap up the existing function into another function that cleans the data - to me this better encapsulates and expresses the ideas:\n\ncontact\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  location age_groups n_contacts\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 QLD      15-19             100\n2 NSW      15--19            125\n3 QLD      20--24            150\n4 NSW      20-24             200\n5 QLD      25---29           225\n6 NSW      25-29             250\n\nclean_contacts &lt;- function(data){\n  \n  data |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    age_groups = clean_age_groups(age_groups)\n  )\n\n}\n\nclean_contacts(contact)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  location age_groups n_contacts\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 QLD      15_19             100\n2 NSW      15_19             125\n3 QLD      20_24             150\n4 NSW      20_24             200\n5 QLD      25__29            225\n6 NSW      25_29             250\n\n\nSome of the improvements I notice\n\nWe are just focussing on cleaning up the age group column.\nWe have given it a name that refers to cleaning up the data, which might also give us some space and room to add more cleaning function here.",

There are really useful toy examples of writing packages that deliver praise (e.g., ones I’ve used to teach R packages in the past: https://github.com/njtierney/praiseme), or do simple conversions between units (celcius to farenheit being a very common example).\nThese examples are useful because they teach you the tools, and the process. However in this course, I want to focus on a bit more than this and incorporate the process of turning code into functions. I think this is important, because it more closely represents other examples we come across in using R, and presents a bit of a richer learning journey, because in addition to learning about the tools and the process of R package building, you will also learn:\n\nHow to think about converting scripts to functions\nHow to write better functions\n\nI have written up some example code, which starts as a quarto document.

Theres stuff everywhere.\n\n7.2.1 move the data to data-raw\nLet’s clean up all the existing data and move it into a special data-raw folder. The data-raw folder exists in R packages as a place to hold original copies of data that will eventually be cleaned up and shared in the data folder. For the time being, we can store our data sets in here, and we’ll come back to it later.\n\n\nRun use_data_raw()\nMove raw_education_2014...2019.csv into the newly created data-raw folder\n\n\n\n7.2.1.1 Running use_data_raw()\nWhen we run use_data_raw(), we get a message like the following:\n✔ Setting active project to\n  \"/Users/nick/github/njtierney/learned\".\n✔ Creating data-raw/.\n✔ Adding \"^data-raw$\" to .Rbuildignore.\n✔ Writing data-raw/DATASET.R.\n☐ Modify data-raw/DATASET.R.\n☐ Finish writing the data preparation script in\n  data-raw/DATASET.R.\n☐ Use `usethis::use_data()` to add prepared data\n  to package.\nThis is the usethis package’s way of telling us a couple of nifty things:\n\nDATASET.R is a file it has created, this is where you document changes to the data before it gets saved into the data folder\nthe data folder gets created with usethis::use_data() - we will come back to this.\n\nA takeaway point from this is that the usethis package is quite chatty, and quite helpful!\nYou can see my initial commit of use_data_raw() here: https://github.com/njtierney/learned/pull/2/commits/c47b00349c922411e207598a567f85226bc6b1b4\n\n\n7.2.1.2 Move CSVs into data-raw/\nThere’s a few ways to do this, personally, I just use RStudio’s file interface and move the files around. Here’s what that looks like: https://github.com/njtierney/learned/pull/2/commits/05720d1bcedc177905f71ebbb4a994b83f6da9e0\n(note that this is effectively a renaming, so there’s not much going on in this commit)\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Delete old quarto files, move one into vignettes\nWe don’t need the alpha-bravo-charlie of it all anymore, we can just stick with one. We’re going to move it to a special folder called a “vignette”. We’re going to shelve it there for a little bit.\n\n\nDelete “analysis2014.qmd” and associated HTML/folders\nDelete “alpha-analysis2014.qmd” and associated HTML/folders\nDelete “bravo-analysis2014.qmd” and associated HTML/folders\n(potentially move “solution-charlie-analysis2014.qmd”) into root level and delete “charlie-analysis2014.qmd”)\nDelete “solutions” folder\nrun use_vignette(\"analysis-2014\")\n\n\n\n7.2.2.1 deleting old files\nHere’s the commit of deleting and moving files, and deleting solutions folder\n\nhttps://github.com/njtierney/learned/pull/2/commits/fd74956d7fe7326b1e2c81f546b2a0086b65275e\nhttps://github.com/njtierney/learned/pull/2/commits/c1aac99ffdc7b1261116180bdd504b8236d4e660\n\n\n\n7.2.2.2 Creating quarto vignettes\nOnce we run\nuse_vignette(\"analysis-2014\")\nWe get another nice chatty message from usethis:\n✔ Adding knitr to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION.\n✔ Adding \"inst/doc\" to .gitignore.\n✔ Adding rmarkdown to Suggests field in\n  DESCRIPTION.\n✔ Adding \"knitr\" to VignetteBuilder.\n✔ Creating vignettes/.\n✔ Adding \"*.html\" and \"*.R\" to\n  vignettes/.gitignore.\n✔ Writing vignettes/analysis-2014.Rmd.\n☐ Modify vignettes/analysis-2014.Rmd.\nYou can see the commit for this, here: https://github.com/njtierney/learned/pull/2/commits/4da0a62bb704591ae62d6104e38b6c6d24b6a088\nNote that although we started with a Quarto vignette, it opened an Rmarkdown vignette. It is actually possible to use a quarto vignette - as described in the Quarto R package.\nAnd, just because I want this to be more on the side of bleeding-edge erring to timeless, we’re going to do that. There’s a few steps, so hold on.\n\n7.2.2.2.1 update VignetteBuilder\nOpen the DESCRIPTION file, and replace knitr with quarto in VignetteBuilder.\nhttps://github.com/njtierney/learned/pull/2/commits/e1b0f8b7fbc9a980e2f1bba692bdf1c79dd454ad\nThen, copy our “solution/charlie-analysis.qmd” file into vignette folder\nhttps://github.com/njtierney/learned/pull/2/commits/dcd99c067e1d8606a4771ef5afa8c4cef21f1511\nThen, add some of the appropriate metadata into the quarto YAML:\nhttps://github.com/njtierney/learned/pull/2/commits/fabf10bada36913c5a3045f0f754cc166820510e\nFinally, delete the other Rmd file, and rename ours “analysis-2014.qmd”\nhttps://github.com/njtierney/learned/pull/2/commits/ec15dcf145ac58492a781d4380ba738f1f40dfea\nIt’s worthwhile noting that this vignette in its current state will not build properly, but we will get to it later.",

To do this, I’m going to recommend you create a special R file, sometimes called a “scratch file”. It lives inside a folder called inst, which is typically not touched by R package building. This is a useful trick if you want to have a way to play around with some R code, keeping it inside your R package.\n\nCreate a scratch file:\n\nCreate a directory inst\nInside that directory, create an R file called scratch.R (note that this can actually be called anything, but scratch.R is what I use)\nWrite library(learned) inside scratch.R\nRead in the raw education 2014 data from data-raw, and use one of the functions from the R package, like clean_education_data(). What happens when you use this?\n\n\nSee the commit for this at:\nhttps://github.com/njtierney/learned/pull/2/commits/5779d2b1ff7c4f5f87b4babdfe47ca608b6ebf3c\nIf you’re like me, I got this error:\n&gt; clean_education_data(raw_education_2014)\nError in mutate(data, age_group = clean_age_groups(age_group), prop_studying = na_if(prop_studying,  : \n  could not find function \"mutate\"\nLet’s pick this up in the next section, “How to use extra packages”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a non-standard way of making an R package\n\n\n\n\n\nThis whole approach we have taken in this course, is not what I would describe as “the standard way” to make an R package. This represents a bit of a funny situation, where we have taken an existing workflow, and then morphed things into an R package. The benefits to this are that it is useful for teaching. And sometimes, this is how things happen.",

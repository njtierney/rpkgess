<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

R packages allow you to share your code.

This is a course on how to develop your own R packages. The target audience is R users who have experience writing their own R code and functions, and/or are enthusiastic about the idea of sharing their R code across multiple projects.

This will grow and change over time as a living book.

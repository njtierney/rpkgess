# How to use extra packages

One of the major shifts from writing R code and analyses to writing R packges is how you interact with other R packages you want to use.

- previously use library
- cannot use library in pkg
- idea of overloading namespace
- using pkg::fun

introduce workflow:

- `use_package(pkg)`
- `pkg::fun()`

- show commits
- show how DESCRIPTION changes

- note about using Tidyverse - instead we must call packages directly
- note about Imports vs Depends. We only really use Imports.
- note about package versions - usually a good idea.
- note/philosophy about dependencies. Greedy approach is (in my opinion) best, because you don't waste human cycles. Best approach is greedy, then prune back

- wrap up by using the package successfully in scratch.R
- which leads us to consider making the data accessible
